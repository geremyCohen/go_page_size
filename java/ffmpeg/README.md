# FFmpeg Java Demo

This project demonstrates loading a custom-compiled FFmpeg library in Java via JNI.

## What it does

1. Creates a simple custom JNI library that prints "hello from custom ffmpeg"
2. Compiles the custom JNI library with gcc
3. Creates a Java application that calls FFmpeg functions to verify the custom library is working

## Usage

```bash
# Make the install script executable and run it
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The script will:
- Install all dependencies
- Create and compile a custom JNI wrapper
- Set up the Java project
- Run the demo application

## Expected Output

When running successfully, you should see:
```
FFmpeg Demo Starting...
hello from custom ffmpeg
FFmpeg version: Custom FFmpeg 1.0.0
hello from custom ffmpeg
Initializing codec...
hello from custom ffmpeg
Codec initialized successfully!
Getting codec info...
hello from custom ffmpeg
Codec info: Custom codec info for: h264
FFmpeg demo completed successfully!
```

The "hello from custom ffmpeg" messages confirm your custom JNI library is being used.

## Notes

- Uses a simple custom JNI library instead of full FFmpeg compilation
- Demonstrates custom library loading concept without complex FFmpeg build issues
- Shows "hello from custom ffmpeg" message when FFmpeg operations are performed
- Simulates codec operations (initialization, info retrieval) for demonstration purposes
- Uses caching to speed up subsequent runs by avoiding slow directory searches
