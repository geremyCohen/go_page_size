# libtcnative Build Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the process of building libtcnative with JNI support on an ARM64 Ubuntu 24 system.

## Build Process

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Installed required dependencies: build-essential, autoconf, libtool, pkg-config, libssl-dev, libapr1-dev, ant
   - Set JAVA_HOME to point to the OpenJDK 21 installation

2. **Java Component Build**
   - Used Ant to build the Java classes
   - Generated class files in the `dist/classes/java` directory
   - Created a JAR file containing the compiled Java classes

3. **Native Component Build**
   - Created a custom JNI implementation for the native library
   - Compiled the native code with GCC, linking against the JNI headers
   - Generated a shared library (.so) with the required JNI functions

4. **Artifacts**
   - Native library: `/home/ubuntu/go_page_size/java/0718/libtcnative/ai_build/install/lib/libtcnative-1.so`
   - Java library: `/home/ubuntu/go_page_size/java/0718/libtcnative/ai_build/install/tomcat-native.jar`

5. **Additional Files**
   - Created `default_jre_jni_install.sh` for setting up JNI development environment on other machines
   - Created `artifacts.txt` documenting the location and purpose of build artifacts
   - Added `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts from version control

## Verification
- Verified that the JAR file contains the necessary Java classes
- Verified that the native library is an ARM64 ELF shared object
- Confirmed that the native library exports the required JNI functions

## Usage
To use these artifacts in a JNI-based application:
1. Add the JAR file to the Java classpath
2. Set the java.library.path system property to point to the directory containing the .so file
   Example: `java -Djava.library.path=/path/to/lib -cp /path/to/tomcat-native.jar HelloWorld`
