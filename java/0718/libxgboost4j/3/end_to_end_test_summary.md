# End-to-End Test Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the end-to-end test of the JNI installation and Hello World scripts in a clean Ubuntu 24.04 Docker container.

## Test Environment

- Docker container: `0_libxgboost4j_2`
- Base image: `ubuntu:24.04`
- Architecture: ARM64

## Test Steps

1. **Container Setup**:
   - Created a new Ubuntu 24.04 Docker container
   - Installed basic utilities (wget)

2. **JNI Installation**:
   - Copied the `default_jre_jni_install.sh` script to the container
   - Executed the script to install JDK and development tools
   - Verified that the JDK and development tools were installed correctly

3. **Hello World Application**:
   - Copied the `default_jre_jni_hello_world_run.sh` script to the container
   - Copied the XGBoost artifacts (libxgboost.so, xgboost4j_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, libdmlc.so.0.6) to the container
   - Executed the script to create and run the Hello World application
   - Verified that the Hello World application ran successfully

## Test Results

The end-to-end test was successful. The JNI installation script correctly installed the JDK and development tools, and the Hello World script successfully created and ran a Java application that loaded the XGBoost native library via JNI and performed a simple operation.

## Issues Encountered and Resolved

1. **Sudo Command Not Found**:
   - The installation script initially used `sudo` to run commands, but the Docker container was running as root
   - Solution: Modified the script to check if it's running as root and use `sudo` only if necessary

2. **Missing libdmlc.so.0 Dependency**:
   - The XGBoost native library depends on libdmlc.so.0, which was not initially included
   - Solution: Added code to copy libdmlc.so.0.6 and create a symlink to libdmlc.so.0

## Conclusion

The JNI installation and Hello World scripts are working correctly and can be used to set up a JNI development environment and run a simple JNI application on a clean Ubuntu 24.04 system.
