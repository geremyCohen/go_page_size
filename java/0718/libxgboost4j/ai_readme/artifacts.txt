Usage:
- When using these libraries in a Java application, all files need to be available.
- The .jar file should be included in the Java classpath.
- The .so files should be in a directory that is in the Java library path (java.library.path).
- Alternatively, you can use System.load() to load the native library explicitly, but you need to ensure that all dependencies are in the same directory or in a directory that is in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
