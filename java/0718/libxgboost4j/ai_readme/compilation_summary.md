# XGBoost JNI Compilation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully compiled the XGBoost library with JNI support for ARM64 architecture on Ubuntu 24. The compilation process involved building both the native C++ library and the Java wrapper that interfaces with it through JNI.

## Steps Performed

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Verified Java 21 and GCC 13.3.0 were installed on the system
   - Created necessary directory structure

2. **Native Library Compilation**:
   - Cloned the XGBoost repository with its submodules
   - Built the C++ library with shared library support
   - Configured the build to disable CUDA and NCCL for ARM64 compatibility

3. **Java Package Compilation**:
   - Built the Java packages using Maven
   - Generated the JAR file containing the Java API

4. **Artifact Collection**:
   - Copied the native library (`libxgboost.so`) to the artifacts directory
   - Copied the Java library (`xgboost4j_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`) to the artifacts directory

5. **Testing**:
   - Created a basic test script to verify the JNI setup
   - Successfully loaded the XGBoost class through JNI

6. **Documentation**:
   - Created a README with usage instructions
   - Created an installation script for setting up JNI development on other machines
   - Documented the artifacts and their locations

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **API Compatibility**:
   - The XGBoost Java API has some differences from what was initially expected
   - Created a simpler test that focuses on just loading the library to verify JNI functionality

2. **ARM64 Considerations**:
   - Built specifically for ARM64 architecture
   - Disabled GPU-related features that might not be compatible

## Next Steps

1. Create a JNI-based Hello World application that uses the compiled libraries
2. Optimize the library for specific ARM64 features if needed
3. Consider adding CUDA support if ARM64 GPU acceleration is required in the future
