# XGBoost JNI Build Summary for Arm64

## Overview
This document summarizes the process of building libxgboost4j with JNI support for Arm64 architecture on Ubuntu 24.

## Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 24.04 (or compatible)
- OpenJDK 21
- CMake
- GCC/G++
- Maven
- Git

## Build Process

1. **Clone the XGBoost repository with submodules**
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost.git
   ```

2. **Ensure cstdint header is included in JNI source files**
   - The cstdint header is already included in the source files:
     - xgboost4j.cpp
     - xgboost4j-gpu.cpp

3. **Build XGBoost with JNI support using CMake**
   ```bash
   cd xgboost
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DJVM_BINDINGS=ON -DUSE_CUDA=OFF -DUSE_OPENMP=ON
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

4. **Build JVM packages with Maven**
   ```bash
   cd ../jvm-packages
   mvn clean package -DskipTests
   ```

5. **Artifacts Generated**
   - JAR files:
     - xgboost4j_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
     - xgboost4j-spark_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
     - xgboost4j-flink_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
   - Native libraries:
     - libxgboost.so
     - libxgboost4j.so

## Verification
The build was successful, and all necessary artifacts were generated. The JNI support is properly enabled, and the native libraries are included in the JAR files.

## Next Steps
To use the compiled libraries in a Java application:
1. Add the xgboost4j JAR to your classpath
2. The native libraries will be automatically loaded from the JAR
3. Use the XGBoost Java API to create and train models

For a custom JNI application, you may need to specify the path to the native libraries using the java.library.path system property.
