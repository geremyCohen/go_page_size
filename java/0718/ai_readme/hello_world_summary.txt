JNI Hello World Application Summary
================================

1. Created a Hello World application that demonstrates how to use the libucrypto JNI library:
   - HelloJNI.java: The main application that loads the JNI library and calls native methods
   - run_hello.sh: A script to compile and run the application

2. The application demonstrates the following JNI methods:
   - generateKey(int length): Generates a random key of the specified length
   - encrypt(byte[] data, byte[] key): Encrypts data using a key
   - decrypt(byte[] data, byte[] key): Decrypts data using a key

3. Created a script (default_jre_jni_hello_world_run.sh) that can be used to set up the Hello World application on another machine:
   - Creates the necessary directory structure
   - Creates the HelloJNI.java file
   - Creates the run_hello.sh script
   - Makes the script executable

4. Successfully tested the Hello World application:
   - The application loads the JNI library
   - The application calls the native methods
   - The application verifies that the encryption/decryption works correctly

5. Created documentation:
   - hello_world_readme.md: A README file for the Hello World application
   - hello_world_summary.txt: This summary file
